The analysis of an air quality data set involves examining various air pollutants, meteorological conditions, and their temporal and spatial patterns to understand the air quality status and trends. This process typically includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical analysis, and visualization.

Key Steps in Air Quality Data Analysis
Data Collection and Cleaning:

Sources: Air quality data is often collected from sensors and monitoring stations. Common pollutants measured include PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, and O3.
Cleaning: The raw data may have missing values, duplicates, and outliers. Techniques such as interpolation, deletion, or imputation are used to handle these issues.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Descriptive Statistics: Calculate mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and range for each pollutant.
Visualization: Use plots like histograms, box plots, and time series plots to visualize the distribution and trends of pollutants.
Correlation Analysis: Identify relationships between different pollutants and between pollutants and meteorological variables (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed).
Temporal Analysis:

Seasonal Trends: Examine how air quality varies by season (e.g., winter vs. summer) and identify patterns like higher PM levels in winter due to heating.
Diurnal Patterns: Analyze how air quality changes within a day, typically showing rush hour peaks for traffic-related pollutants.
Spatial Analysis:

Geographical Variation: Map pollutant levels to understand spatial distribution and identify hotspots.
Source Identification: Use spatial patterns to infer potential sources of pollution (e.g., industrial areas, traffic corridors).
Statistical and Predictive Modeling:

Regression Analysis: Develop models to predict pollutant levels based on meteorological data and other factors.
Time Series Analysis: Use ARIMA, Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series (STL), or other time series models to forecast future air quality.
Machine Learning: Implement algorithms like Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, or Neural Networks for more complex predictions and pattern recognition.
Health Impact Assessment:

Air Quality Index (AQI): Calculate AQI to provide a simple indicator of overall air quality.
Exposure Assessment: Estimate population exposure to different pollutant levels and assess potential health risks.
